# Mini RAG System Project

This project is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built in Python using Hugging Face Transformers. 
It uses a retriever model (MiniLM) to find relevant information and a generator model (DistilBERT) to extract answers.

## Features
- Semantic search with embeddings (MiniLM)
- Extractive Question Answering (DistilBERT)
- Extendable knowledge base
